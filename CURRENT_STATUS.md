# SoftEther VPN Client - Current Status

## ✅ WORKING FEATURES

### Connection
- ✅ Successfully connects to VPN server (devworxstand.662.cloud:443)
- ✅ TLS 1.3 encryption enabled
- ✅ Stable connection (no crashes, no auto-disconnect)
- ✅ Daemon mode working (-d flag)
- ✅ Graceful Ctrl+C handling

### Network Configuration (As per Stanislav Requirements)
- ✅ **TCP-ONLY MODE**: PortUDP = 0 (no NAT-T, no UDP)
- ✅ **Half-Duplex**: 2 TCP connections (MaxConnection=2, HalfConnection=true)
- ✅ **No UDP Acceleration**: NoUdpAcceleration = true
- ✅ **No QoS**: DisableQoS = true
- ✅ **Bridge Mode**: DeviceName = "_SEHUBBRIDGE_"

### Packet Handling
- ✅ TUN device (utun6) created and operational
- ✅ Ethernet frame stripping/adding (14-byte header)
- ✅ Layer 2/3 translation working
- ✅ UDP port parsing fixed (uses IHL field correctly)
- ✅ DHCP DISCOVER sent after 2-second delay (tunnel establishment)

## 🔄 IN PROGRESS

### DHCP Automatic Configuration
- ✅ DHCP state machine implemented (4-way handshake)
- ✅ DHCP DISCOVER sent correctly (292 bytes, broadcast to 255.255.255.255)
- ✅ MAC address generation (CA prefix, official SoftEther format)
- ✅ Waiting 2 seconds after tunnel establishment before sending DHCP
- ❌ **ISSUE**: Not receiving DHCP responses from server
  - Only receiving SoftEther keepalive packets (UDP 5678)
  - Server is in Local Bridge mode (DHCP provided by Mikrotik CHR at 10.21.0.1)
  - 3rd party app (SSTP Connect) successfully gets DHCP on same server

## 📋 CURRENT NETWORK DETAILS

- Server: devworxstand.662.cloud:443 (77.48.2.123)
- Alternative: worxvpn.662.cloud:443 (cluster farm, ticket auth)
- Hub: VPN
- User: devstroop
- Server Mode: Local Bridge (SecureNAT disabled)
- Network: 10.21.0.0/16 (255.255.0.0)
- Gateway: 10.21.0.1 (Mikrotik CHR)
- NAT Provider: Mikrotik CHR (not SoftEther SecureNAT)

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

Based on Stanislav's guidance: "DHCP must be requested to internal interface when it is already connected"

1. Investigate why DHCP responses aren't arriving despite:
   - Bridge mode enabled ✅
   - 2-second delay after tunnel establishment ✅
   - Correct DHCP packet format ✅
   - TCP-only mode ✅

2. Possible issues to explore:
   - Routing: DHCP broadcast may need special handling in bridge mode
   - ARP: May need to handle ARP requests before DHCP works
   - Interface state: May need to configure interface with temporary IP first
   - Server-side: May need specific client identification for bridge mode

## 🔧 MANUAL CONFIGURATION (TEMPORARY WORKAROUND)

While DHCP is being debugged, users can manually configure:

```bash
sudo ifconfig utun6 10.21.255.100 netmask 255.255.0.0 up
sudo route add -net 10.21.0.0/16 -interface utun6
sudo route add default 10.21.0.1
```

## 📝 STANISLAV'S REQUIREMENTS (FOR PRODUCTION)

- ✅ 2 TCP connections, half-duplex
- ✅ No UDP acceleration
- ✅ No NAT traversal
- 🔄 DHCP for IP configuration (in progress)
- ⏳ Add default route for all traffic (pending DHCP)
- ⏳ Auto-reconnect on failure (to be implemented)
- ⏳ No IPv6 (to be confirmed)
- ⏳ Wi-Fi switching capability (future)

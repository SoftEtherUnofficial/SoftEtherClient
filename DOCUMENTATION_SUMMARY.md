# Documentation Creation Summary

## What Was Created

I've analyzed your working Zig implementation and created comprehensive documentation explaining the key differences between **SecureNAT** and **Local Bridge** server modes, particularly focusing on:

1. **Ethernet frame handling** (Layer 2) vs **IP packet handling** (Layer 3)
2. **MAC address learning** through ARP
3. **Header stripping** (incoming) and **header adding** (outgoing)
4. **Gratuitous ARP keep-alives**

## Documents Created

### 1. SECURENAT_VS_LOCALBRIDGE.md (~800 lines)
**Main technical reference document**

Sections:
- Executive summary
- Packet format differences (with hex diagrams)
- Client implementation requirements (SecureNAT vs Local Bridge)
- MAC address learning (why and how)
- Keep-alive mechanism
- DHCP handling differences
- Configuration flags
- Code structure comparison
- Real-world examples from your codebase
- Summary table
- Key takeaways

**Key insight**: Local Bridge requires ~2700 lines vs ~500 for SecureNAT due to Ethernet translation and ARP handling.

## Key Technical Findings Documented

### 1. Packet Format Difference

**SecureNAT (Simple)**:
```
[IP Header 20+ bytes][Payload]
```

**Local Bridge (Complex)**:
```
[Dest MAC 6][Src MAC 6][EtherType 2][IP Header 20+][Payload]
```

### 2. Critical Operations for Local Bridge

**Incoming (VPN → TUN)**:
```c
// Must strip 14-byte Ethernet header
if (ethertype == 0x0800) {  // IPv4
    write(tun_fd, packet + 14, size - 14);
}
```

**Outgoing (TUN → VPN)**:
```c
// Must add 14-byte Ethernet header
eth_frame[0..6] = gateway_mac;  // Learned via ARP!
eth_frame[6..12] = our_mac;
eth_frame[12..14] = ethertype;
memcpy(eth_frame + 14, ip_packet, ip_size);
```

### 3. ARP Requirement

Three critical ARP operations:
1. **Gratuitous ARP** - Announce our MAC/IP to server's table
2. **ARP Request** - Ask "Who has gateway IP? Tell me"
3. **ARP Reply parsing** - Learn gateway MAC from response

### 4. Keep-Alive Mechanism

```c
// Send Gratuitous ARP every 30 seconds
if ((now - last_keepalive) > 30000ms) {
    SendGratuitousArp(our_mac, our_ip);
}
```

Without this, server ages out the client's MAC/IP entry and stops forwarding!

### 5. Code Complexity

| Mode | Lines | Main Tasks |
|------|-------|------------|
| SecureNAT | ~500 | Pass-through |
| Local Bridge | ~2700 | Translation + ARP handling |

## Key Insights Documented

1. **TUN devices are Layer 3** - They expect raw IP packets
2. **Local Bridge servers send Layer 2** - Ethernet frames with MAC headers
3. **Translation is mandatory** - Can't mix Layer 2 and Layer 3
4. **MAC learning is critical** - Without it, packets go to broadcast (inefficient) or nowhere
5. **ARP keep-alive is essential** - Server will age out entries without it
6. **EtherType detection is key** - Bytes 12-13 tell you if it's Ethernet (0x0800=IPv4, 0x0806=ARP, 0x86DD=IPv6)

```

## Troubleshooting Guide

Four common problems documented:
1. No connectivity after connecting → Check MAC learning
2. Packets corrupted → Check header stripping/adding
3. Connection drops after 5 minutes → Implement keep-alive
4. ARP replies not received → Check ARP request format

Each with symptoms, checks, and solutions.

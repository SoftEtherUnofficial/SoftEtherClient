## 🔑 Key Takeaways

### The Core Insight (Yours!)

You identified the winning pattern:

```
✅ Already done:
   C TUN/TAP adapter → Zig FFI → Pure Zig
   Result: Increased performance, simplified build

✅ Apply same pattern:
   OpenSSL (C) → rustls-ffi (C API) → Zig bindings
   Result: Eliminate platform issues, simplify build
```

### Why This Works

1. **Proven Pattern**: You've already done this successfully
2. **Stable API**: rustls-ffi provides C interface
3. **Production Ready**: Used by Cloudflare, curl, Mozilla
4. **Eliminates Pain**: No more OpenSSL platform issues
5. **Incremental**: Can migrate gradually, port to Zig later

### The Numbers

| Metric | Current (OpenSSL) | Proposed (rustls) |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| Platform issues | High | None |
| Build complexity | High | Low |
| Dependencies | System-specific | Self-contained |
| Migration effort | N/A | 4-6 weeks |
| Binary size | Smaller | +2-3 MB |
| Runtime deps | System OpenSSL | None |

**Verdict**: Benefits >> Costs
